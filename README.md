## <h2 align=left> **About the Project** </h2>

The primary objective of this project is to simulate a business consulting firm while engaging in a hands-on project. In this scenario, a client approaches us to analyze the opportunities for opening a restaurant somewhere in the state of New York.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

Relevant data about restaurants, reviews, and other key metrics are collected while using the [Google Maps](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wf7YkxA0aHI3GpoHc9Nh8_scf5BbD4DA) and the [Yelp](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TI-SsMnZsNP6t930olEEWbBQdo_yuIZF) provided DataSets.

#### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, explore and analyze the data to better understand trends and patterns.

3. **Seasonal Growth:**
   - Definition: Absolute count of visits during high season periods (June to August).
   - Goal: +10%.

4. **Business Count Growth:**
   - Definition: Absolute count of businesses with reviews.
   - Period: Annual.
   - Goal: +5%.

5. **Price Category Growth:**

   - Period: Annual.
   - Goal: +3%.

#### Step 4: Recommendation Model

Finally, build a recommendation model to provide our client with a list of restaurants comparable to theirs.

This project aims to provide our client with valuable information for strategic decision-making and a deeper understanding of the local restaurant market.
