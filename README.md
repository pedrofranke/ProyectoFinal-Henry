The primary objective of this project is to simulate a business consulting firm while engaging in a hands-on project. In this scenario, a client approaches us to analyze the opportunities for opening a restaurant somewhere in the state of New York.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

In this phase, relevant data about restaurants, reviews, and other key metrics are collected.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, explore and analyze the data to better understand trends and patterns.

### Step 3: KPI Dashboard Creation

Build a dashboard presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) defined by the client.

#### Main KPIs on the Dashboard:

1. **Positive Reviews Growth:**
   - Definition: Absolute count of positive and neutral reviews.
   - Period: Annual.
   - Goal: +10%.

2. **Visits Growth:**

### Step 4: Recommendation Model Creation

Finally, build a recommendation model to provide our client with a list of restaurants comparable to theirs.

This project aims to provide our client with valuable information for strategic decision-making and a deeper understanding of the local restaurant market.
